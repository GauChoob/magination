# Magi-Nation Script Reference
The game runs up to 4 main script threads that run game code:
1. **Master**
	- Handles Scene initialization
2. **Scroll**
3. **System**
	- Handles Triggers
4. **Text**
	- Handles the Textbox and dialogue

In addition, there can be up to 10 Actors, such as NPCs, that run 2 scripts each:
- **Script0** runs the Actor's main code
- **Script1** runs the Actor's graphics

Each script command is usually reserved for specific threads, or may only work in specific threads.

# Sample Scripts
