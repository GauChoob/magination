This is the format of the ISAS files musyx.o, musyxb0.o, musyxbank00.o

All strings are terminated with a $00 byte

-----

The file starts with a header. For these 3 files, the header is always:

	ISOBJECTVer 1.08 960821 N.Nakano (null-terminated)

	for a total of $21 bytes

-----

Then you reach the main file. The file is divided into chunks:

ID
LENGTH
DATA

ID identifies what the chunk is used for (1 byte)
LENGTH is the number of bytes of DATA. It does not include the length of ID or LENGTH
	Usually this is 1 byte, however sometimes it is 2 bytes long
	If I'm not mistaken, bits 0-6 is length, and bit 7 is a flag saying whether LENGTH is 2 bytes long
	If bit 7 is set, then the second byte is also part of the length, and the length becomes
	LENGTH = BYTE1*128 + BYTE2
	(to be confirmed)
DATA is information based on the ID

Here are the known IDs:

00: Filename, or null string
02: Global label name, used for linking. Name of label is provided
05: DATA contains raw hex code
06: Transforms into a 16-byte address (refers to a global or local label)
08: Local label (no name is provided)
13: Bank name
