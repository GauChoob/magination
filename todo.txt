Change tests to not rely on compiled files (i.e. autopack test)
Compile package so location of packages doesn't matter

Define non-standard tile offsets (e.g. CardsceneFX -> $40)
Preview all sprites (both .spr files as well as SCRIPT_ANIMs)
Add tests for sprite preview, sprite palettes and sprite non-standard offsets

Don't define banks in game.asm, move them directly into the child .asm files
