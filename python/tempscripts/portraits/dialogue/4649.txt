"Wow! I've... never seen anything like this! "
"Don't worry about him. This happens more than you would think. Anyway, how do we stop it, then? "
"That is the Core Glyph! Then... you must be.... Oh my, this is not good. "
"Leave the Underneath as soon as you are able, Kyros. For all our sakes. "
"Let's go, everyone! "
"I am Motash, Elder of this beautiful town. "
"I'm sure Gogor will return victorious. "
"Please hurry and collapse the Shadow Geyser! "
"Take this elixir, quick! "
"Everyone must stay off the streets! "
"What a vicious earthquake! "
"We need to do something, yes... perhaps we should evacuate to the surface... "
"Hold on, hold on... let me think... "
"Ulk, take care of Gruk. We'll go take care of this Shadow Geyser. "
"You... you... "
"I know who you are. You will not succeed... "
"...I see. Then am I to meet the same fate as Gogor? "
"I've never even heard of those things... "
"I don't know... I just don't... "
"Gruk was just kidnapped by some really weird-looking creatures! They were just in town making demands which we can't meet. Ulk is very upset about it. "
"They said they were going to the abandoned tower through the tunnel to the North. "
"Who were those guys anyway? "
