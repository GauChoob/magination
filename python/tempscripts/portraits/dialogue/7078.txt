"I can't leave my own party! "
"I can't leave my own party! "
" Party more  Go with Elder"
"Thanks, but I'm still checking the party out. "
"Alright, let's see the surprise! "
"Ummmm.... "
"I guess so... "
"WHO'S BAD!!! "
"No thanks... "
"Weird. "
"I can't leave while the town is under attack! "
"They need my help! "
"This town will be destroyed without me. "
"There are still evil Magi running loose! "
"Wha....? Who are you? "
"The door is barricaded from the inside... "
"I'm going to see the Elder, "
"Of course I am! How else am I going to get his help? "
"Sorry, there's nothing I can do about that. "
"Hey! Cut that out! "
"Fine! Just let go of me! "
"Footwear? "
"JUMP across?! Do I look crazy to you?! "
"Okay, I'll give you another chance. So how do I get these boots? "
"WHAT?! ME? Why me?! "
"No, that's not what I meant! "
"......... Oh forget it... "
"...they're never going to buy this... "
"......... Unbelievable. "
"This must be where they store the training equipment. "
"Scary. And big. "
"Scary. And big. "
" No  Yes"
"Maybe I should train some more. "
"Yep! "
"Okay, tell me about... "
"What can I do? "
"How can I keep from getting hit? "
"And how do I win the fight? "
"So what can my creatures do for me? "
"Sounds useful. "
"Anything else? "
" OOOOOH YEAHH!!  Uh... no."
"I think I've had enough of this guy... "
"Uh... It's good for you! "
"IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!! "
" No  Yes"
" No  Yes"
"Won't we get in trouble if Orwin finds us here? "
" No  Yes"
"Yes I do! "
"Nope. "
" No  Yes"
"I'll do that. "
"What's going on? "
"......... "
"Who are you? "
"Mugh? "
"I don't suppose you'll just let me go? "
"I figured. "
"That's my cue to get out of here. "
"I better hurry out of here! "
"That's funny... what are these? "
"I found something... "
"Reminds me of my dog. "
"Creepy. I think it's doing its job a little too well. "
"You're welcome. "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"If I don't follow him, I'll probably get lost.... "
"No, sorry but I haven't. "
"Since I have followed him this far, it would be foolish to  stop now "
"Well, this is it... time to go home. "
"Well, this is it... time to leave. "
"Whoa! Deja vu! "
"Just to say goodbye. "
"Why? "
"Gia? What's going on? Where is everybody going? "
"You mean... "
"......... "
"What's going on? "
"Kyros? But I thought you said... "
"Is he going to be okay? "
"OUCH! "
"Who was that? "
"...and... ...it's... ...moving?? "
"YAAAAAUUGH!!! "
"There's a note. "
"Wow, she even welded the doorknob... what's in here? "
"......... Uh, nope. Not me. "
" Who's Orwin?  Yes I am!"
"Is this the Ringsmith's shop? "
"Hi. I'm Tony Jones. I was told by Eidon to show you this crystal. "
"Furok? Animite? What are you talking about? "
"Furok? Animite? What do you mean? "
"Furok? Animite? I don't understand. "
" No  Yes"
"So I can use this to buy stuff? "
"What does that mean? "
"Dream Creature? Is that what a Furok is? "
"I guess it's lucky for me that I found this just lying around. "
"Sure. "
"Thanks. "
"Who's that? "
"Ok, thanks. "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"The wall is spongy here. "
"Lumpily smooshy! "
"Smooshy! "
"Mushy! "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"Tony blows through one of the stool's hollow legs. "
"Uh, oh. "
"Careful, it's... "
"No, wait! It won't work! You can't- "
"As I was trying to say, you can't seal it that way. It hurts whoever tries to touch it. "
"Only I can go in, because I have this Glyph thing. "
"Don't worry, I'll take care of this geyser. "
"Possibly a complex instrument for mining. Or a bed. "
"A real miner's bed. Soft as a big ol' slab of stone! "
"This chair has scratches on it. "
"This chair has scratches AND bite marks. Scary. "
"Looks like this this thing has served as a scratching post for quite a while. "
"Uh... hi. "
"Berserker what? "
"What is that? "
"AAAAAAAUGH!! "
"Yeah, great... "
"Get me away from that thing... "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
" Yes  No"
"Filled with books on how to fight the mortal enemy of productivity: sleep. "
"She should clean more often. "
"A perfect chair for watching TV in. Now if only there were a TV. "
"I wonder if she grew this, too. "
"May I ask why you are so tired? "
"Gruk? "
"What was that? "
"That light over there is probably what Jaela was talking about. "
"Maybe... ......... ...nah... "
"Perhaps I don't have to go back right away... "
" For justice.  To get home."
"......... "
" I refuse!  Do it, then."
"You just want to get rid of me so you can ruin this world. I won't have any of that, not after what everyone here has done for me. "
"That's far too much suffering! You mustn't harm these  people, it's unforgivable! "
"Wrong! I'm going to put an end to this right now. I'm sending you back to the Wastelands. Tell your misguided followers to choke on their so-called justice. "
"Thy hour of reckoning is upon thee, Agram! "
"What a strange- looking statue. "
"Stone. It's made of stone. "
"There sure are a lot of these around here... "
"Hmmmm... "
"Oops. Better be careful. "
"This is the Core. "
"I understand now... Morag probably sent you here, and Agram turned you to stone. "
"Never mind. You're okay now that the threat to the world is gone. "
"Yeah. "
"UHHH... NO!! NO, no, no. The way out is THAT way. "
"It's the least I can do. "
"Your secret is safe with me, Majesty. "
"What's that? "
"And what about you? "
"Yeah. She mentioned something about Dream Creatures and stuff. "
"Didn't Orwin say I wasn't supposed to leave town? "
"Well, if you say so... "
"Eidon? Where'd he go? "
"Huh!? "
"I didn't know. "
"I can't get out! "
"Well... I think he mentioned that there was the occasional manual labor... "
"Gruk! You're alive! "
"What happened? "
"Isn't Gogor here? "
"Gogor was just turned into stone like all of Agram's victims. When I defeated Agram, everyone returned to normal. I know I saw Valkan here, so Gogor must be around somewhere... he might have gone back to the Underneath, or he could be right here in Vash Naroom. "
"Hi Eidon, how's it going? "
"I WIN!!!! "
"Oh yeah... "
"Wow, the resemblance is... "
"...nonexistent. "
"Sure. "
" Explain!  No need."
"Well? "
"......... "
" Yes.  No."
"Your what? "
"There's a note here. It says, -COULDN'T WAIT FOR YOU, WENT TO FIND MONSTER WITHOUT THE ALGAE. WISH ME LUCK!- "
"Excuse me, but shouldn't we go back to town now? "
"Tony. "
"Uh... "
" Give Algae  Don't give"
"Clothes! Wow. Something normal. "
"I wonder if there's a friend under this pillow for me... Nope. "
"Spooky! "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
" Maybe later  See the show"
"Maybe later... "
"Okay, I'll watch... "
"...!? "
"No, that's okay I'll just.... "
"Great... now what am I supposed to do? "
"That is SO comforting... "
"I'm not going to leave my own party! "
"Queen? "
"Are you all right? "
"I'm Tony. "
"Thanks. "
"Why? "
"......... "
"... I... "
"... I don't... "
"Well, the old guy said that Dispel X can break spells... Time to see if he's right. "
"BEHOLD! DISPEL X! "
"Thank you... "
"Smells like... like... halibut!? "
"A water bed. Go figure. "
"This bed ripples like the tide. "
"Guh! Sea urchin! "
"Bandages and wrappings. Hmm... "
" Yes  No"
"No, but your Historian was helpful. "
"Nice to meet you too. "
"How do you move a whole city? "
"This? "
"That's not important now. As long as I have this, I can enter the geyser. I just need a way to get there. "
"Him? "
"Thank you. "
"A set of books chronicling the different Dream Creatures of the Moonlands. "
"It's covered in beaten up books and torn out pages. "
"There's a book leveling this table. I can just make out the title: Evu's... Day... at... Jellybean... Beach. ... Oh boy. "
"Cold. "
"What do you know about barriers? "
"There's some kind of electric field blocking my progress in the geyser. "
"Er... Like lightning. A wall made out of lightning. "
"I suppose. "
"Great! "
"So has it been worth the trouble? "
"Really? "
"I'll check it out. "
"Thanks! "
"Actually... I've already been there. "
"What? What is it? "
"WHAT!? "
"What's wrong? "
"Okay... if you say so. "
"Hey Orlon, can you make me a ring? "
"......... "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"It does?! "
"......... "
"??? "
"..... "
"Ow! Hey, there's something here. "
"What's this? "
"Hey, there is some Animite! "
"Was that rock there before? Hmmm... Oh well. "
"Nice view... "
"I am honored to meet you, your majesty. "
"......... "
"SHUT UP!! "
"I don't want to hear your lies! YOU'RE the one who's been creating the Shadow Geysers! "
"AAARGH! I can't believe it! What a JOKE! Your days are numbered, you gigantic, bald-headed, clog-wearing FREAK! I'll carve a curse on your tombstone! "
"Grrr... You... MONSTER... "
"......... "
"The truth...? "
"....... "
"I don't care what that Agram guy says. These people asked for my help, and they're going to get it. "
"Hey... Where's my translation bracelet...? "
"Here it is. It must have fallen off when Agram zapped me. But how was I able to understand him? ....... "
"Tony got a Blurry Scroll "
"Tony got a "
"Tony got a "
"Tony got a "
"Hey, there's something in this Algae! "
"Tony got a "
"A horn? "
"Thanks, I appreciate it. "
"Oh well, back to Cald. "
"My name is Tony. I came to open the vault. "
"No, I was sent by-- "
"No, just listen for a-- "
"LISTEN! I was sent by the Elder in Cald. He told me to open the vault. "
"You mean the key doesn't work? "
"......... "
"It looks like it. "
"You're welcome... "
"Hey there's something in this plant. "
"Tony got a "
"Fresh out of treasures in this plant. "
"Hmm... Something here. "
"Tony got a "
"Fresh out of treasures here. "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"Hey there's something in this plant. "
"Tony got a "
"Fresh out of treasures in this plant. "
"Hey there's something in this plant. "
"Tony got a "
"I'll have to wait for more items to grow in this one. "
" Uh...ok.  I'll pass."
"What kind of inn doesn't have beds? "
"Hey there's something in this plant. "
"Tony got a "
"Only plants left here. "
"Hey there's something in this plant. "
"Tony got a "
"Nothing here but water and dirt. "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"Thanks. "
"Hmmm... There's a bone stuck in the base of this grate... I'll pull it out. "
"What was that? "
"What is this? Some kind of rock? I don't think it's Animite. "
"Uh oh, this place is coming apart. I'm out of here! "
"What the... "
"Who are you? "
"This... Shadow Geyser? "
"But Gia called it a Shadow Geyser. "
"Where am I? "
"... where is this? "
"Oh..... "
"I...didn't get much of a chance to look. From what I saw I don't know how anyone could have survived. "
"I'm sorry. I know you had friends down there... "
"I have to go after Morag. He has something I need. "
"I understand. I hope you find them. "
" Yes  No"
" Yes  No"
" Yes  No"
"It's welded to the floor. "
"Full of random junk. "
"Junk occupies this space. "
"What...? "
"Blankets!? Madness! You'd roast like a turkey! "
"This looks to be melting. "
"My name's Tony. Tony Jones. "
"I heard that you are the Master Bridge Builder of Cald. "
"Well..... I need a way to get over the lava pool in front of the Shadow Geyser. "
"Lava Arboll? "
"No problem. "
"Okay, here. "
"Not yet. "
"That's odd, "
"Hmmmm... "
"What the?.... "
"These are all joke books? "
"I hardly want to read all of these! "
"Hey...! Wait a minute! "
"This bed looks soft and comfy. Sleep here for the night?  Sleep here  Don't sleep"
"I'm not that tired. "
"Ahh, that's much better. "
"A simple wooden chair. Or is it? "
"I fear the inevitable of sitting down. "
"I've got a prize view of this chair from right about here. "
"Uh, are you sure this is the way to Cald? "
"Hey, are you really sure this is the right way? "
"Is this Orothe? "
"Can you direct me to the vault? "
"What? "
"Hey Orlon, can you make me a ring? "
"......... "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"It does?! "
"......... "
"Hey, the ferry left! How do I get back to Cald? "
"......... "
"What is it? "
"Lead the way. "
"Just springs and a torn sheet. "
"Filled with vile goo. "
"I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"What's that switch over there for? "
"-IT'S LOCKED- "
"-TONY UNLOCKS THE DOOR. THE KEY JAMS AND BREAKS IN THE LOCK- "
"This door doesn't even have a keyhole! "
"It looks radioactive... "
"OK, who did that? "
"Covered with shredded cloth. "
"Who could sleep in a place like this? "
"Clogged with gunk. "
"I think I'm gonna be sick! "
"Sheesh. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"Sheesh. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to "
"-IT'S LOCKED- "
"-TONY UNLOCKS THE DOOR. THE KEY JAMS AND BREAKS IN THE LOCK- "
"Wow, he was rather ungrateful... "
"There's a big pile of worms under this mattress! "
"Something's bubbled up in here, and it doesn't look friendly. "
"-THE DOOR IS SCREWED SHUT- "
"-TONY UNSCREWS THE DOOR WITH THE SCREWDRIVER- "
"What was that? "
"Uh oh. "
"This must have cost at least seventy-five dollars or so. "
"Components of a dark, heartless place. "
"Looks like they didn't have time to finish. Something must have happened. "
"A giant, rusted screw. "
"Wow! That's the second biggest screwdriver I've ever seen! "
"What is this stuff? "
"Disturbing. "
"Sheesh. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"-IT'S LOCKED- "
"-TONY UNLOCKS THE DOOR. THE KEY JAMS AND BREAKS IN THE LOCK- "
"AAAAAHHHH!!!! "
"Oooo, that's gonna leave a mark! "
"Uh oh... "
"This one looks ready to pop. I'd better get out of here! "
"Looks like he was trying to get back in bed. "
"Old bones emitting a pale greenish aura... "
"Cold as the grave. "
"Someone's final resting resting place. "
"... "
"... "
"There's a note here. Hmm... It's covered in weird squiggles and dots. "
"Sheesh. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"Sheesh. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"-IT'S LOCKED- "
"-TONY UNLOCKS THE DOOR. THE KEY JAMS AND BREAKS IN THE LOCK "
"Looks like they got more than they expected. Curiosity can have its consequences... "
"Ugh. The walls're all slimy and wet. "
"This must be put here for torture. This thing is harder than the floor. "
"Strange, I  can't see anything but darkness through here. "
"Hey! This is my stuff! The armband from Orwin... My digging gloves... Agadon's boots, and my translation bracelet! "
"Smells of decay. "
"There's grungy slime in this one. "
"A rotting bed. "
"Covered in dust and bugs. "
"It's dripping. "
"It's missing the knobs. "
"It reeks. I should leave it alone. "
"Ooo, a feather. "
"Ouch... "
"I've been caught again. This sure isn't helping my confidence any. "
"I've got to get out of here. "
"W-What was that noise? "
".........hmm. It's quiet again. "
"I wonder who this Agram guy is? "
"I'd rather not stick around to find out... "
"...but it looks like I'll have to. "
"??? "
"This is a familiar situation. "
"Oh no! Morag took my translation bracelet... Who's there? I can't see you! "
"GEEZ! Be careful! "
"Hello? "
"Eww. I think I liked it better in the cell. "
"Well, whoever got me out of there is gone. Looks like I'll have to find the exit myself. "
"A feather. It sure looks out of place here. "
"Wow, this is pretty high up, I wonder if I should go  back or try to find my way down here? "
" Go back  Look here"
"That's a long way down... the water would soften the landing, but I can't swim... "
"Well, I seem to be in a fix, here... That guy back at the vault said to blow the horn if I needed help... maybe this would be a good time... "
"AIEEGH!! "
"They'll throw me back in that cell! "
"I hope this works! "
"ACK! Huff... bleah! I - can't - swim! "
"Whew! I almost drowned! "
"Oscent Marrrrr? "
"Well, I guess I'll see how well this belt works.... "
"Comfy. For fungus. "
"More mushrooms. Who would've guessed? "
"These things are everywhere. You'd think they were pets. "
"Squooshy! "
"Hmmm... How much floor space do they lose to arbitrary fungus? "
"Mushroom. Plain and simple. "
"Deals.  "
"Who's that sharp looking fellow? Why, it's Tony Jones! "
" Yes  No"
"A book of local events... "
"Sounds dangerous. "
"Ahh, yes. Chairs that mold to your form. "
"Do they grow these at the mushroom farm? "
"A window. Why? "
"This mirror looks overused. "
"One of such stature must watch his figure. Hence heavy objects on sticks. "
"Such a tiny bed for such a big head. How does he do it? "
"Who is that? "
"My name is... "
"......... "
"...oh really. "
"A necessity for a leader of the community. "
"A most intimidating read. "
"A bin of strange looking bits and deals. "
"It's moving! "
"Knick knacks. I should leave them be. I don't want to break anything. "
"Chairs grown right from the ground itself. Cool beans! "
"Yuck! Mushrooms. "
"Hmm... Mushrooms. I hear these things are yummy. "
" Try some  Don't"
"Blah! These taste like styrofoam! "
"I wonder if these mushrooms are an acquired taste... "
" Try more  Don't"
"Hmm... pretty good! "
"I don't feel so good. "
"These mushrooms are great. "
"Thank you "
"No I won't. "
"Nice and neat. Every corner tucked in. "
"Messy. Hmm... Someone here is selectively clean. "
"Mushroom chairs... What's next? "
"They're everywhere! "
"My name's Tony. "
"You're Wence's friend? "
"We met in the forest at Naroom. "
"Who is your sister? "
"Gogor, huh? "
"Another comfy chair. They really know how to sit in style down here! "
"Maybe the beds are seeds of the houses... One day this bed will grow up to be a house. Yes you will! "
"Another bin of deals. "
"There are wisps of steam rising from this chair... It's actually boiling! "
"The heat has dried it out like burnt toast. "
"Ugh! Sticky, melted deals. "
"This must be her storage shed! I wonder what she keeps in here? "
"Oh. "
"I really don't think I need to go back into the 'storage shed' again. "
"Firewood! Just like Grandpa used to make! "
"Perfect cuts of wood. It can only be expected. "
"A barrel. "
"Another barrel. "
"A mighty wood burning furnace. Harnesses the power of burning wood with its mightiness. For the cooking of pots and stuff. Yeah. "
"Wow! A cabbage so big I could sleep in it! "
"What's in this stuff, anyway? "
"Every hut should have its own special frog weather vane. "
"It won't open. "
"Hi, Eidon. I stopped the Shadow Geyser! "
"I also found this strange stone inside. Do you know what it is? "
"Wow! Thanks! "
"I will tell you and Gia all about it. "
"Hey Eidon, guess what? "
"Eidon? "
"What are you doing here? "
"Oh.... "
"Something awful just happened. I need to talk to Gia. "
"Um, Eidon? ... Eidon? "
"What are you doing here? "
"I... uh... "
"Darn. I really shouldn't tell him about the Arderials... That would be disrespectful since they want to stay- "
"... "
"... "
"I can see Gia later. What I need to do right now is stop that Arderial Shadow Geyser. "
"Gia, look what I found at the Geyser. "
"I guess. The geyser closed when I removed this from it. "
"But there are three more slots. Where do I get the other three stones? "
"Actually, I did notice someone, but he went too fast for me to see clearly. "
"He went into a cave. I tried to follow him, but he disappeared. I did find these crystal blades, though. "
"Thanks for your help. "
"North of where the Geyser was, but I didn't follow him. "
"..And then I came here! "
" Sure  NO!"
"Well.... Okay. "
"Hey, you're the old bat from before! "
"Kyros!? "
"Prophecy? "
"Hmm... I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about that. I just want..... "
"How did you know? "
"Or Eidon told you! "
"So if I take it to the Shadow Geyser, I can get to the  Core Region? "
"You said the key to using the Glyph lies in the Geyser right? "
"Oh, sorry, I kind of blanked out after that. "
"????? "
"By the way, where is this Core Entrance? "
"I got another Core Stone... "
"...but the geyser caused a quake in the Underneath, and destroyed the nearby city. I.... don't think anyone survived. "
"Some guy named Morag. He nearly wasted me. "
"Uh...y-yes... Do you know who he is? "
" Okay  Not really"
" Keep going...  Kinda boring"
"Anyway, he has the remaining two Core Stones, so I have to find him. "
"All kinds of old books and rusty gadgets. "
"Knick knacks, trinkets and mibobbers. Hey, look! A picture of Eidon. "
"Better hope she doesn't run out of firewood, little stool. You might be next! "
"The fun never stops. "
"A chair of comfy-ness! There's a Gia shaped groove in this chair. "
"This must be the waiting... er... nook? "
"Nothing under here but some cobwebs and a bug or two. "
"Gia! I found some weird crystal blades at the Geyser. "
"Thanks for your help. "
" Yes  No"
" Sure  I'm busy..."
"Sure. "
"Why? "
"Okay.... "
"I'm busy... "
"........... "
"No! I won't let you get away with this! "
"Uhh... Look up there! A Flame Hyren! "
"Yeah. "
"Okay, here you go. "
"I'll give it back later. "
"Lakes of fire and rock. Cozy! "
"I'm surprised this thing works. It's all melty! "
"Too hot to nap on. "
"Hmph! Nothing! It's hardly worth my effort to root around stranger's houses. Inconsiderate strangers! "
"I'd sit for a spell... But I'm afraid I'd melt. "
"Kidney shaped comfort. "
"Hypnotic. I want to look again. "
"A molten table. How very last year. "
"I wonder what's in - OW!!  Hot! "
"It's Tony. What's yours? "
"That's right. Who are you? "
"A right proper bed. "
"Old man things. "
"Ugh! The drawers are stuck! "
"Rickety. "
"Looks rough and itchy. "
"Melty. "
"Lot's of big sulfur spewing vents out there. Yup. "
"Must've gotten a bargain on this real estate. "
"Oh no, I overslept! They started the party without me! "
"That key must be around here somewhere... "
"I... uh... err... "
"Here's my chance to return that key... "
"I'll just put this back. "
"I'll just hang on to this a bit longer. "
"I already gave it back. My conscience prevents me from stealing it again. "
"11:05. But is it AM or PM? "
"Clothing... Colorful. Striking. Sleeveless. "
"Wow! "
"Seems nice. 'Cept for the fire and all. "
"Filled to the brim. Good thing it's melting. Otherwise, it'd never stay closed. "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"I'd figure. Yeah. "
"I must inspect this! Hmm... Nothing. "
"Why do I feel the urge to mess with people's stuff? Oh well, can't be helped I guess. "
"Some of these drawers are melting. I think I'll leave this alone. "
"Crawling under some covers just doesn't seem appealing right now. Whew. "
"This must be the time out chair. "
"Pigs, goats, and chickens. On fire. "
" Yes  No"
"Yaki? "
"I could ask you the same thing. "
"Uhh, sure, see you around. "
"A ginourmously big bed. "
"Big hammers. Tiny hammers. Furry hammers. Squishy hammers. "
"Round hammers, flat hammers, hammers with points. Geeze... "
"Hmm... Hammers... Hammers... ... More hammers... "
"An iddy biddy diddy bed. "
"This lavafront property must really be in demand. "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"What's up, guys? "
"My name's Tony. Tony Jones. I moved here a few days ago. Who are you? "
"...no...it's Tony Jones. "
"Whatever. How? "
"Fine. I'll be back shortly. "
"......... "
"What? "
"I didn't get it. "
"There was a cave-in... I think? "
"I.... don't remember... "
"It'll be great living here... "
"Phew! It's good to be home! "
"There was a cave-in, I got the crystal, but I lost it in the cave-in. "
"Sure! "
"Well, I guess I'd better get this over with. "
"Oh no! I'm trapped!! "
"WAAAAAAAGH!!! "
"Got it! "
"Oh no! I've gotta get out of here! "
"Is this.... home? "
"It's broken! "
"It won't budge. "

"This Shadow Geyser is causing the people of Cald a great deal of trouble, so I have to stop it. "
"What? "
"......... "
"Well, I- "
"Agram? Who is Agram? What mission? "
"......... Things just get weirder and weirder... "
"Wha..? "
"I was just.. "
"You do? "
"You are? "
"Oh... "
"No. "
"Impressive... Can't say it rings a bell though. "
"Haven't heard of him. "
"Nope. "
"No. Listen, I came here to find the Seer. Have you seen him recently? "
"Yes. Is he around? "
"Hello? "
"....... "
"Oh, for crying out loud! Is the Seer around here or isn't he? "
"Hey! What? What are you doing? "
"Orwin is sick, and the people of Vash Naroom said you could help. "
"Yes... "
"I can't use my "
"I can't cast "
"Empty! Noooo!! "
"It won't budge! "
"It's just a pile of  rubble... "
"Sorry, I don't know how to grow mushrooms. "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"I almost wound up like that... "
"Err... actually... well, I mean I was there, but I really- "
"Tony. "
"No, I'm looking for someone. "
"I'm not quite sure, but... "
"Earthquake? Again? "
"Wait... what was it that burst from the ground? "
"Another Shadow Geyser? "
"No time to explain. If the geyser is closed, the quaking should stop. "
"Oh no!!! "
"You! You're the one I saw in Naroom! "
"So it was... you... "
"Wence! "
"Thanks Wence... "
"......... "
"I'm... okay... just a little tired... "
"Hello. "
"Huh? Why? "
"Of what? All I see is a destroyed town. "
"There's this evil guy who's name is-- "
"Really? "
"Really. "
"Oh, sorry. "
"Well, if I ever find some I'll be sure to give it to you. "
"Bookcase. Full of booky goodness. "
"Bird-feeder. Spiffy. "
"A chair for sitting. "
"Ash... "
"Tony got a ",$FC," "
"It doesn't respond. It's just a 'door'. "
"It doesn't respond. It's just a 'fireplace'. "
"It doesn't respond. It's just a "
"AAAAAAAAGH!!! "
"It doesn't respond. It's just a 'chair'. "
"Some burnt books... "
"This chair has burn marks... "
"Hmmm.... ... ... What's that on the bottom shelf?... "
"AAAAAUUUGH!!! "
"Hmmm.... ... ... It's... a bookcase. ... ... And... it's empty. "
"Sooty. "
"Tony got 5 Animite "
"I shouldn't look in... huh? The drawer is moving. I'll just take a peek... "
"AAAAAUGH!!! "
"I shouldn't look in other people's dressers... "

"Looks like the fungus hollowed out the legs of this stool. "
"Ooo, squishy. "
"The fungus has completely taken over this stool. "
"........? "
"I have this fungus in a jar. You want it? "
" Give fungus  Don't give"
"Nope, sorry. "
"That was powerful fungicide. "
"What happened here? "
"Oh, sure. All this needs is a little fungicide. "
"I sure hope this stuff works. "
"It won't budge. "
"There is a branch  blocking the view. "
"Hey I can talk to this one! "
"What powers this thing? "
"That's okay. "
"Thanks! "
"Poad, do you have any more of those jellybeans? "
"Yes, please. Thanks! "
"It's locked. "
"...uh.. ..yeah.. "
"Poisoned?! "
"What is it? "
"Yes, But what is it? "
"OKAY! What is it? "
"ARRGH! What is it CALLED! "
"Thanks. "
"Where can I find a Cloud Frond? "
"....Sure. "
"Well, don't strain  yourself! "
"He's getting worse. "
"This is all my fault. I should never have disobeyed Orwin. "
"That's okay, Eidon. I never really believed it myself. "
"That's okay, Eidon. I never really believed it myself. "
"Why aren't you at home, Gia? "
"Is something wrong? "
"What? "
"WHAT!?  But... That can't be! Maybe I'm not the Great Magus but what about all the Shadow Geysers I've closed? How can you treat me this way after all I've done!? "
"I... I can't believe it! "
"... "
"Well, I guess that's what I wanted. To get home. ... Goodbye, Gia. "
"Nice to meet you. "
"Tavel Gorge. "
"So... what now? "
"Orwin's... celestial.... ...thing. "
"It's you! "
"I didn't know this would happen! I tried to leave- "
"......... "
"... ... ...?? That's strange... shouldn't the geyser be closing now? "
"Morag! "
"Is that so? I think there really is a way to stop it. "
"You won't find it so funny a few minutes from now. "
"We'll see about that. "
"Whew. It worked. "
"This door has a star shaped keyhole. "
" Forge  Equip  Power  Done"
"This wall looks unstable. "
"I've encountered these before. This is a Shadow Geyser. It probably wouldn't really matter if you could get near it, since Magi can't enter it. "
"However, I can enter it because I have the Core Glyph. "
"You... don't know what it is? I thought everyone in this world knew about this Great Magus Kyros stuff. "
"Nobody? Not even your mother? "
"Doesn't she visit you? "
"Oh, sorry. Well anyway, I just have to find a way to get to that geyser, then I can stop it. "
"This door doesn't even have a keyhole! "
"Hard as stone and just as cold. "
"Dirty and covered in rust. "
"I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to rescue you! "
"See you later. "
"Well, I'll do what I can for them. "
"-IT'S LOCKED- "
"-TONY UNLOCKS- THE DOOR. THE KEY BREAKS IN THE LOCK- "
"Hmm.. It won't open. "
"Well, this is it... I'm going home. "
"Why am I so bummed out about this? This is what I wanted all along, wasn't it? "
"Sure, maybe it was fun playing hero and all that, but... "
"...it's better if I leave. After all, Gia said I was the cause of all those problems. ......... It's the right thing to do. "
"Let's see... if I just put the Glyph there... something should happen. "
"I'm fine, Eidon. Just a little winded. "
"!!!! "
"Just... who are you? What did you do to Eidon? "
"Wait a minute, I recognize that voice... "
"So what do you want with me? "
"A Shadow Geyser? That's impossible! I have all the Core Stones here in the Core Glyph. "
"I see. Okay, let's go. "
"What's going on? "
"Getting.... ....dizzy.. "
"Um, it isn't Orwin. "
"Oh, great... Here we go again. "
"Feeling better? "
"He's still eating his jellybeans. "
"AHHHH! STOP!! "
"Hmmm, all of Poad's jars are empty. "
"Eww, they're all licorice ones. "
"I understand. I should probably leave now. "
"Goodbye, Eidon. "
"If everyone cooked like you, maybe I would. "
" Yes  No"
"Are you the innkeeper? "
"No thanks. "
"AAAAAAAAHH!!! "
"Are you sure? I could really use some- "
"Okay, I get the point, jeez... "
"This is too far to jump there must be a better way across this... "
"Like that! "
"I'm Tony. "
"No, it was Morag! He just... "
".......... "
"Yup, here you go. "
"What the.... "
"Where the heck is this? "
"What the...?!! "
"What? I don't understand you! "
"What language are you speaking!? "
"I think he's crazy. "
"Two words... three  syllables... sounds like... bird? No wait... plane? "
"Put it on? "
"Hey, I can understand you now! "
"I'm Tony. "
"...ring? "
"This crystal? "
"I don't know! I have no idea what is happening here! "
"I'm from Tavel Gorge. Do you know how I can get back? "
"Okay. "
"Can I get a ride to Orothe? "
"300?! I can barely carry that much! "
" Pay 300  Don't pay"
" Yes  No"
" Pay 600  Don't pay"
" Pay 550  Don't pay"

"WHAT?! "
"This doesn't look like Cald to me... "
"Thank you. "
"Just for once could I please meet someone who is normal? "
"Hey! The ferry's gone! How will I get back!? "
"What!? "
" Pay 300  Don't pay"
"Fine. Take it. "

"YEEEOWWW!!! "

"Nothing else here. "
"A history book. Somebody's scribbled all over it! "
"A history book. Eww! The pages are stuck together with jellybeans. "
"Uh, I'm not... "
"Excuse me, does the historian live here? "
"Please don't let this guy be the historian. "
"What's with this guy? He wants... jellybeans? "
" They're mine!  Okay, share"
"What's with this guy? He wants... jellybeans? "
"Are you the historian? "
"Erm... "
"Actually... "
"I can't deny it. "
"Hey!  Wake up! "
"Um... Did I come at a bad time? "
"YOU'RE WELCOME! "
"......... "
"Wence, what are you doing here? "
".......   Yeah... Shame on whoever brought it into town. "
"Wence, what are you doing here? "
"What about Orwin, can't he do anything? "
"What can I do? "
"I'll try it. "
"Uh, no... wait a second, you mean he's running loose in town?! "
"......... ...yeah...sure. "
"What about you? Aren't you going to look for him? "
"...sure thing. Noooo problem. Heh... hehe... Well... ...bye now... "
"Maybe later. "
"Sure. "
"Nope. "
"Yup! "
"He's fallen asleep. "
