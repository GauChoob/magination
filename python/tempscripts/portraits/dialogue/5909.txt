"Don't hurt me! "
"Well, then, see you around! "
"Can I help you? "
"Of course! That'll be 300 Animite. "
"Take it or leave it, it's your choice. "
"Thanks, ALL ABOARD! "
"Nice talking to to you, enjoy the Cald. "
"You don't have enough Animite! "
"You again? You want another ride after leaving me hanging in Orothe? "
"Then go away. You bother me! "
"Ok, since the ferry is my livelihood I'll give you a ride, but this time I want all my money up front. It'll cost you 600 Animite for a ride. "
"Hmmm... Well, you seem like a nice enough kid. I'll make it 550. "
"WHAT!? How can you refuse my generosity? I'll tell you what... Pay me 475 now, and I won't charge you to wait. That's my final offer. "
"Really? .... Look... I have a wife and seven kids to feed. I'll let you by on 300. "
"I'll be honest. Forget the wife and kids. I'm broke. I lost all my dough playing cards with Orlon. Just do me one favor and ride my ferry for 200. I'd really appreciate it. "
"199? "
"How about 100? Anything less than that and I'm taking a heavy loss. I'm begging you. "
"Alright, 50 Animite! Please take it. It's the best deal you will ever get! "
"What? you won't give me even 50 Animite for a ride? Try me later and see what kind of price you get. "
"Bah! You don't even have that much Animite. But a deal's a deal. Come bank when you can afford to pay. "
"We're ready to sail, would you like a ride? "
"Well then, nice talking to you. "
"It will cost "
"Then I can't give you a ride. Goodbye. "
"You don't have enough Animite. Come bank when you can afford to pay. "
"Where would you like to go? "
"It will be 300 more Animite for us to wait for you. "
"My time is valuable. I can't afford to wait around for buffoons. "
"What? You're not giving me the money? Let's see if you ever get another ferry ride from me again. "
"Ok, I'll wait. Be quick! "
"I'm sorry. It seems you don't have enough Animite. "
"Enjoy the swim back. "
"Change your mind? "
"I'll wait for you here. Be quick. "
