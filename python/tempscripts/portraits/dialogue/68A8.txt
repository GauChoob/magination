"Orwin... "
"I'm glad to see you, but..... "
"You came back after all! "
"Ahhh! W-What are you doing? Get away from there! "
"You'd better not be trying to open that door! "
"I'm so relieved that Orwin is getting better! "
"Orwin was always so kind to me.... Can you go find the  Seer and ask his help? "
"Hi, Tony! "
"Hello! Are you a friend of Orwin's? "
"Oh, you're not? Orwin is the elder of Vash Naroom, silly! Everyone knows that! "
"Can't find him, huh? He lives in the North- East part of town. "
"Yes it is! My name is Pruitt. How can I be of service? "
"Hmm... let's see... Oh, this is "
"You don't know about Animite? Shall I explain it to you? "
"Well, Animite is a kind of crystal. We use ordinary Animite as money around here. "
"No no no! Well, I mean normally you could, but this is infused Animite! "
"Well, if you take infused Animite, and give it to me, I can make a ring for you that will allow you to control a Dream Creature! "
"Right. You may have seen a few outside of town. Both the Animite we use as money and infused Animite come from Dream Creatures. But a Dream Creature does not produce Animite unless it's been weakened, so you must first defeat one to get it. To do that, you need to use the Dream Creatures you have. I can help get you equipped with one if you need it. "
"It sure is! "
"Here you go! "
"Ooo, there's a little Animite left over. I'd really like to study this, so can I buy it from you for 50 Animite? "
"No problem! Hey, why don't you show that ring to Evu? I'm sure he'd be interested. "
"Evu's the historian... er, when he can remember. You should meet him. "
"No problem. "
"I'm so worried about Orwin... "
"So... what kind of ring should I make? "
"Okay! One ",$FC," ready to go! "
"Sorry, Tony! Your Ring Bank is full. "
"Bye! "
"Uh, hi Tony! Sorry but I'm closed! Go awa- I mean, please leave. "
"Hi Tony! Feels good to be able to unwind for a change, doesn't it? "
"This is such a great party! And we have you to thank, Tony! "
