"Arr, sad. Don't know who the guy was, but I miss him already. "
"Arr, Toney! Heya matey! I'd like ye ta meet me mama. "
"Thanks to ye, Toney, I'm now closer ta town and she can visit me more often! "
"Arr, this is making me dizzy... "
"...but we can stop it! "
"Toney! Good timing, matey. Haul yerself over here and join us. "
"Aye. "
"Mobis, I'm tellin' ya, there's no need to go! Toney here can stop the Black Thingy! "
"...well, I guess thar's no point arguin' with ya anymore... but at least let someone stay behind ta help Toney out! "
"Like me! I want to help! "
"Arr... dang it. "
"Can't ye do better than that, Mobis? "
"Good luck to ye, Toney. "
"Good luck to ye, Toney. "
"Arr, good. I just came in to tell everyone that the city is about to leave. "
"Let's go for a swim. "
"Arr... It be another boring day.... Nothin' ever happens around here anyhoo... "
"Har har har... No luck, eh Toney? "
"Wait a second, Toney. "
"Ye've helped me, so accept my thanks and take this. "
"Arr! If yer ever in trouble and I'm in earshot, I'll be comin' to help ya out. "
"No problem, matey! Free at last from me boring duty, and I've got ye to thank fer it. Bon voyage! "
"Avast!! Anchors!! Arr.... ....... "
"I don't know how ye did it, Toney... "
"Avast!! "
"Ahoy ya scallywag! Who be ye, and what ye be doin' there? "
"Is that so, ye silly poopdeck swabber? I think maybe yer up to somethin'! "
"You come to ridicule me, 'aven't ye? "
"Arr, it's the eyepatch, isn't it. I wanted a black un, but I ended up with-- "
"Elder? Cald? No idea what yer talkin' about, matey. You'd best be givin' up if you want ta open the vault. Nobody's ever been able to. "
"Key? What be a key? "
"Ye may as well give it a try, Toney. "
"Is that all that was in there? Shincovers? "
"What a waste. But since you cleaned out the vault, that means that I'm free! No sense in guardin' an empty vault, is there? Thank ye, matey! Thanks a lot! "
"Thanks matey! "
"Wax me wellisks! Toney's tootin' a shanty on me horn! But whar is the pup? "
"Arrr! Wonderful divin', Toney! A perfect ten! "
"Yer quite the weirdo, Toney. "
"Ah, I know... take this. "
"Thar ya go! "
"Anyways, I'll take ye back te Oscent Marrrrr! "
"Arr, the city I hail from. Oh yeah, and thar's somethin' else ye ought te be seein'. Just follow me, Toney! The belt will let even yer landlubber gills breathe underwater. "
"Ya know, that Black Thingy is causing some major tide around Oscent Marrr and right now we're just tryin' ta figure out what ta do about it. It's also got this powerful forcefield around it so we can't even get near the darned thing. "
"Arr, that stinks. "
"What be that? "
"Toney, I been guardin' that vault since I was old enough ta hold a trident. Me daddy was a guard afore I was, and his daddy afore him. Nobody ever told any of us about the outside world. "
"Me mama wasn't really allowed to be around. Guards like me are raised and trained by their paps in seclusion. "
"Yeah, but she can never stay long. Arr, now I'm all depressed. "
"Arr, I think I'll go in and tell Mobis yer here, Toney. There's nothing but empty sea everywhere so you shouldn't try ta leave. Yer probably tired from all that swimmin' so feel free ta take a rest at the inn. Mobis is in the structure at the middle. See ya there! "
"Well, it be nice havin you around, Toney, but we must be goin' "
"See you later!. "
"See that, Toney? "
"It's a Black Thingy! "
"Arr, named it maself. Thar's never been anythin' like it around here before so I had ta come up with somethin'. Anyway, let's go to Oscent Marrr. "
"Here, boy! "
"Good boy! "
