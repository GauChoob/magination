"Thanks for defeating the Shadow Magi. "
"Lava Arboll? Weren't you going to build a bridge or something? "
"Hi... "
"Go and deal with the geyser. NOW! "
"Valkan is the best bridge builder in our town. "
"You escaped! You are the man, Tony! "
"We found this kid hanging around where it appeared. We'll let you handle it. Bye! "
"You know, it does kind of look like fire if you look close enough... "
"Hey Elder! "
"ASHGAR!!!! "
"We trust that you will handle this. Bye! "
"I was eating lunch and that quake made me fall right off my chair! "
"I think I saw Orwin run down that path. "
"We all helped a bit with the preparations. "
"You there! STOP! "
"He's grown terribly sick since returning from the glade, and Eidon's nowhere to be found. "
"Well you had better go see Orwin soon. I hear he's fading fast. "
"What? But you have the power to see into the future, don't you? "
"But you didn't do anything! "
"Welcome to AVOID THE AGOVOS!!! Want to play? "
"Ok! Here are the rules... Get to the treasure chest before time runs out... but be careful, the Agovos will stop ya in yer tracks!!!! "

"AIAIGGGGHHH!!! "
"Okay, okay, let me try to fix things! "
"Ah.. that's the right one. "
"Oh well.... "
"For my next trick I will teleport you home! "
"Ummmm... jump? "
"Sorry, but I am retired... "
"How's the water? "
"I wish they'd let me go out for a swim once in a while. "
"If you're quiet you can ask me anything. "
"If you're quiet you can ask me anything. "
"Barriers? "
"Et'cleric, you say? "
"Ah!  An "
"Hmmmm... ... I'll tell you a secret. "
"I was brought here by Mobis to study all sorts of relics from the nearby ruins. The soldiers haven't allowed me to visit them, though! They say it's too dangerous, so I am a prisoner until we return to the Capitol. "
"Oh yes! I have seen a number of incredible artifacts! "
"Yes! Unfortunately, Mobis wishes to return early, but I think there's a good chance that you could find something useful in the ruins. "
"If you find anything, just bring it here. I'll appraise it for you. "
"Do you have anything for for me to look at? "
"Please leave! "
"It's a spell of some sort. In an ancient language. Very ancient! ... "
"..... ..... Great Krakens above! "
"This is Dispel X! I never thought I would see such a thing in my lifetime! This is a spell so powerful... It can dissolve almost any magical binding! But this could only mean... "
"Just trust me!  Hide the spell and leave while you can. Both of our futures are in jeopardy! "
"Hello, I'm the local historian. Feel free to ask me anything. "
"I am the smartest man in town. The mushrooms told me so! "
"Ask me anything. "
"Tony! We are in your debt. Is there anything I can tell you about? "
"Lava Arbolls are very timid. "
"Is there anything else you want to konw about? "
"Nobody wants you here. Go away! "
"Is there anything you want to know about? "
"Why don't you build a bridge? "
"Is there anything you want to know about? "
"Welcome back Tony. "
"Is there anything you want to know about? "
"Party on, dude! "
"Is there anything you want to know about? "
"Would you like to record your journey and recover lost energy? "
"Pleasant dreams! "
"Have a great day!! "
"Funny, I didn't see you come in... "
"I highly recommend you try one of Gruk's mushroom souffles. "
"Flamesol? Isn't that some kind of beverage? "
"What are you doing here? "
"Who? I only see you here. "
"Did you do -aherrrrm!!- -bleck- Pardon me. You did this? "
"Who cares how he did it? The important thing is that we're all still here! "
