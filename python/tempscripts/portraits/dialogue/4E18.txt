"Orwin was a manly man... He has Gogor's respect. "
"Oh, it's you. Have you seen anyone from the Underneath? When I returned there, everyone was gone. "
"Then I will go into town. I will find them. "
"Stand aside, scrawny! This is a job for GOGOR!! "
"Hmm... now let me see... Ah ha!! "
"I'll seal it with this rock! "
"......... "
"Wooh, the world is spinning! Wheeee!--- "
"  "
"Good, you're just in time, little one. "
"I can't open this door. "
"You will help me! "
"Go downstairs and open this door from the inside! Do not be fooling around! Do it now! "
"Make way for Gogor!! "
"I got tired of waiting. "
"Eh? Where are you, silly monsters? I'll smash you into juicy green meatballs! Where's Gruk? "
"HA! The green monsters ran away like little scaredy- cats! "
"Door, monster, tofu, it really doesn't matter what I have to smash! Gogor has completed his mission! "
"I am exploding with delight! "
"Ha ha! Who is this little cream puff who has come to interrupt my favorite routine? "
"IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!! "
"All that matters is that my body is ripped like thick, peanuty nougat! You however are as flat and brittle as a crispy wafer! "
"Now I will tell the tiny one with goofy pants who I am. "
"I am Gogor, celebrated hero of the Underneath! "
"Master of all things requiring my immense pectorals! "
"The man with the accent that drives women wild! "
"The bomb! The man's man! The bee's knees! I am all of these times twenty! Not "
"You again? Go away, for I am staring lovingly at my lovely biceps and abdominals! Shoo! Shoo! "
"It's just a little quake! What's the big deal? "
"Huh? You know something, flabby one? You had better talk... "
"What is all this noise here? "
"Where did they go? "
"I'll take care of this. Wait here. "
"I am he! "
"Ow! OW! Stop that! "
"OUCH!! "
"I was imprisoned! This little one with the silly hair freed me! I went back to the Underneath and nobody was there! "
"Though once "
"OW! OWW!! Cut that out! "
"Gogor has to go now! "
"Oh, it's you. You may be the Great Magus, but I am the Greater Gogor! You are still flabby as a kippered beefsteak... "
"...and I am still ripped like peanuty nougat!! I am the true master of all things heroic! A winner is me! "
"That is me! "
"Ow! OW! Stop that! "
"OUCH! "
"I did go back! I went back to the Underneath and nobody was there! Really! "
"Yes! But have no fear, for I am still the gracious, rock-hard, pumped up hunk of- "
"OW! OWW!! Cut that out! "
"Erm, Gogor has to go now! "
"Yo! "
