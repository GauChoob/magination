"That was close. Thank you, Kyros. "
"I'm glad you will respect our wish to remain hidden. "
"I am indebted to you. "
"Well, the prophecy has now been fulfilled. Now there is but one thing remaining. "
"For you to return home! The path is right through this door. Raise the Core Glyph to the light and you will be taken back to your home world. "
"I will return to the palace, of course. I must undo the destruction that Morag and Agram dealt to my kingdom. "
"Farewell! Have a safe journey home. "

"Thank you Ora, but we shall dispense of the formalities for now. "
"Thank goodness you're here. "
"Likewise, Great Magus. We must act quickly, for the evil ones grow more powerful with each attack. I know you have the ability to stop the Shadow Geyser, so please help us! Since you do not have wings, take this. "
"This will allow you to fly. If there's anything else I can do- "
"Leave us. Ora. "
"Now! "
"......... "
"......... "
"How dare you... "
"You filth, standing there before me with such blatant disrespect. Need I remind you that your power is nothing here? "
"We are also much more powerful than we were back then. We shan't be beaten by the likes of you! "
"AGRAM! "
"Ahhhhh! "
