"Why did this have to happen? "
"Hi, you must be Tony! I'm Tryn. Nice to meet ya! "
"The whole town was shaking, but I didn't feel any wind.... Weird, huh? "
"Ya know, Whenever I'm sick, I always go to the Seer on the lake. "
"Hiya Tony! What ya up to? "
"My two cousins Eryn and Karyn were supposed to come visit me today... I hope nothing bad happened to them. "
"Heya Tony! It's a great party! Lotsa fun! "
"Make enough for me too, okay Poady? "
