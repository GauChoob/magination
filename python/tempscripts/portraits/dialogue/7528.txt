"I really can't believe that happened. That has NEVER EVER happened to me before! Where are you going, anyway? "
"Y-you're not... gonna tell him about the bridge, are you? "
"N-NO! Y-you can't! My... my reputation will be ruined! I'll never get a job here again! "
"I have another idea! Hear me out! Please!! "
"In Orothe, there is a vault that contains the most valuable treasure of Cald... a pair of Agadon's boots! "
"Not just any footwear. These boots allow the person who is wearing them to jump great distances! With them you should be able to make it across the pool of lava! "
"I know it may sound a bit crazy but... I'm not lying! Just trust me, you'll see! "
"So what do you say? "
"Well, like I said they're in a vault in Orothe. You'll need a key to get in, but I'll take care of that. "
"Okay, here's the plan... I'm going to cause a little disturbance in the town center while you sneak into Ashgar's house and grab the key! Good luck! "
"You can do it! I believe in you! "
"Aaagh! Fire!! FIRE!!!!!! There's FIRE everywhere!! Noo! Oh, the humanity! The sorrow!! It's spreading!! We'll all be burnt to a cinder! Our flesh will be seared to the very bone! HOT HOT HOT!! "
"No, it's fire! I mean, look at it! "
"Spare me your dog and pony show! I know what I see, and right there, I see FIRE! "
"OHHHH!! I get it, this is a pool of magma! Well thanks my man Ashgar! I had no idea! "
"I will protect your back, friend! "
"Prepare for termination, Shadow Magi... "
"For the Cald! "
"It's time I end this struggle. "
"This is not a happy day. "
"And since the other one was so rudely interrupted... "
"Tony, what happened? Where are we? "
"The... Core? The last thing I remember is at the party... that floating guy pointed at me and... that's all I remember. "
"Morag? Agram? "
"Threat... to the world? "
"Wow. I don't even want to know. "
"Is that the way out of here? "
"Oh. Thanks. See you later. "
"  "
"Tony! You're the man! Gia told me all about you. Great story. "
"I bet Vash Naroom could use some new bridges and walkways... "
"Oh, you've still got that key, huh? I bet Ashgar was mad about that. "
"Hey Tony! Keep in touch! "
"Hey! You're the one who helped stomp those Core creatures. "
"Nice to meet you, Tony, I'm Valkan. Here's something for your trouble. It's the least I can do for your help. "
"So.... What's up? "
"Yep! That's me! "
"Lava pool, huh? Hmmm..... "
"A flying Dream Creature. I used to have one, but it escaped... "
"Still looking for that Lava Arboll, Tony? "
"Good! You have the Arboll Ring... Let's go to the Shadow Geyser. "
"Oh, hi Tony. So are you ready to give back the key now? "
"Excellent, excellent. I'll take this back to Ashgar as soon as I can. I don't think he's noticed it's missing yet. "
"Okay, just let me know when you're ready to return it. "
"Stupid clock! Every time I try to fix it, it just stops at 11:05!! Arrrgh! "
"Hey, I helped too! "
"Never! Who are you? "
"Orothe is just across the sea, East of here. You can get to it from the docks located down that way. Oh, and try not to upset the ferryman. He can be very temperamental. Well, good luck to you! "
"Tony, you're back! Did you find the boots? "
"Great! So are you ready to give back the key yet? "
"Thanks. If I can put this back quickly, Ashgar will never notice it was gone. See you later, Tony! "
"Okay, but don't take too long. I'll be in town so when you're ready to give it back, just find me. "
"It looks good, Tony, now you can-- "
"Uh Oh... "
"Oops. "
"I'm so embarrassed. Here's your ring back. "
"Tony! Wait! "
"Tony! Hold up! "
"You've got the Arbol? "
