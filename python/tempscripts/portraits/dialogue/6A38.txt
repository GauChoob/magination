"Hmmm... looks like you need more practice! "
"Wow! Great job, Tony! "
"Ready to battle? "
"Oh... OK. "
"Good. Let's Go! "
"I'm Salafy, apprentice trainer! Ready for a training match? "
"Oh... OK. "
"Good. Let's Go! "
"That was great! Come back any time! "
"Oh no! "
"Be warned, this won't be as easy as the past few times! Yaki has finally let me in on his secrets! "
"Behold!! "
"OK! First you should SUMMON a creature to face me and my creature. "
"Use the SUMMON command on the top of your menu, then select a creature. "
"Good! Now, have your creature fight with mine. "
"Oh no! You got my Weebo! Now your creatures can attack me directly. "
"Maybe you should ask someone for help before you go further. "
"Wow! I can see the entire town from here! "
"Oh look! I see a lake over there! "
"It's so pretty up here! "
"Oh look at the Firds' nest! I wonder if there're any baby Firds in it? "
"I wish I didn't have to be training all the time or I would come up here every day! "
"Hey! Listen! "
"So many people down there are laughing and having a good time... "
"Hmm? "
"?? "
