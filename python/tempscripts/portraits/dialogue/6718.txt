"I think I've lost my appetite... "
"Orwin..... "
"Sorry, the inn is closed for today. "
"Boy, I'm so hungry... maybe I'll go fix myself a pie with these jellybeans. "
"Yes I do, right here! I was going to use them to make a pie, but if you want them you can have them! "
"Yes I do! You want some? I was going to make something with them but I can always go get more. "
"I think I've still got some jellybeans... "
"Sorry, but the Inn is closed. "
"I hear Orwin has his appetite back. I'll have to cook something special! "
"Orwin needs help... Maybe the Seer on the lake knows a way to cure him! "
"Tony! You're thin as a rail! Why don't you eat more? "
"Would you like to record your journey and recover lost energy? "
"Goodnight! "
"Have a nice day! "
"Don't go in there! "
"That's me. Poad's the name. You want to stay here? All travelers are welcome. "
"Well, at least have some of my jellybeans before you go. "
