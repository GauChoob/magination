"Howdy everyone! "
"Up to your old cloak and daggering, eh Moby? Hehe... "
"That's interesting. "
"Help? You? "
"I know. "
"As you are departing, it would seem that I must. "
"POOF! You're a ring! "
"Kidding! Only kidding! So what do you want? "
"Here goes! "
"Here's your ",$FC," freaky! "
"Sorry! Your Ring Bank is full. "
"Be careful. Animite causes severe head swelling. "
"Sure! "
"Hey, Blu, how's it going? "
"In that case, I'll see you guys later. "
"Hello, traveler. "
"Yes it is. "
"Vault? I don't know any vault. This is all that's left of Orothe. Yeah. "
"This island, that hut, and me. Yup, that's it. Hee hee... "
"Find anything? "
"I'm all alone, yep, that's right...yep... "
"POOF! You're a ring! "
"Kidding! Only kidding! So what do you want? "
"Here goes! "
"Here's that ",$FC," freaky! "
"Sorry! Your Ring Bank is full. "
"Be careful. Animite causes severe head swelling. "
"Sure! "

"-WHISTLE- "
"Tony, this is Oflardt, a good friend of mine. He can take you to Cald. "
"Good luck, Tony. "
"You can't give it up!! "
"You can't give it up!! "
"Come one, come all, to play Orlon's Rock Shuffle! "
"Hey, Tony! You did pretty well last time! Are you going to try again? "
"Hey there Tony! Want to give it a shot? "
"Great! Do you know how to play? "
"First, I show you where the crystal is. Then, I cover it with a rock and... What? No, the crystal will not break. Why not? It's magical! Anyway I cover it with a rock and move it around along with two other rocks. After five seconds you try to pick the rock with the crystal under it. This may sound easy, but the rocks will not stop! They will continue to move until you stop them by picking one. Understand? "
"Then let's get it on!! "
"GO! "
"And... "
"You lose! "
"And... "
"You lose! "
"And... "
"YOU WIN! "
