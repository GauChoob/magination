"Dude, this place is not safe! "
"If it's so safe, why don't you go in there? "
"No way! "
"Yeah, he'll do anything! Hey Benny, wanna go in the cave? "
"Shut up! "
"Haw! Didja hear that, Sly? "
"Foney Bones is more like it! "
"You don't like your new name? Deal! "
"Okay, Foney! If you don't like your new name, you'll have to earn back your old one. "
"Ooooh! Foney's a tough guy! "
"Uhhhhhh...... "
"Hurry up, Foney Bones! "
"You got a crystal? "
"Where you going? Are you Chicken? "
"Whoa! He's alive! "
"Will you shut up already, Benny?! "
"Anyway, we saw the cave-in. "
"Oh well forget it. Anyone that can survive a cave-in is worth keeping around. You can have your name back, kid. "
"Oh yeah. You should be introduced to them. "
"Our friends... "
"SHUT UP!!!! "
"Oh man, when mom finds out I got the new kid lost in the cave, she's gonna flip! "
"What? No crystal, huh? "
"Can't you ever be quiet Benny? "
"Why, that.... "
