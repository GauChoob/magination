"Sorry. We started without you, Tony. Once the preparations were made and the whole town gathered, we just couldn't wait! Anyway, take a look around the town. When you are ready, we have a surprise for you. "
"Okay, follow me. "
"I guess I was wrong  about you, young man... What did you say your name was again? "
"Well, what did you find? Who's this? "
"I'll deal with you later. I'm going to have a look at this 'black mass'. Don't you dare go anywhere! "
"You unleashed this upon us you fiend! You'll pay for this crime! "
"What?! What is going on out here?! "
"How many times must I explain it to you?! It is nothing more than a small pool of magma, the same one that has been in that spot for over 40 years! "
"Oh, for crying out loud... "
"?? Uh... yeah. Sure. "
"Sheesh, what a weirdo. "
"Oh, quiet you. "
"I was eating my porridge!! What is it?! "
"You stopped it? "
"......... I'm... sorry. We should not have doubted you. "
"Please let us make this up to you. "
"Let me see... what can we do... "
"I've got it! We'll have a celebration! You'll be our guest of honor! "
"Okay, now that that's settled, I need to go handle the preparations. You may stay here in my home until it's all ready. You're probably tired anyway. "
"Please watch from here. I hope you will enjoy it. "

"Yes, though originally our townspeople frowned upon him, this brave person has saved our town from evil not just once, but twice! "
"Join us now, as we portray his gallant efforts of heroism on this very stage! "
"A relentless "
"Then Tony came! "
"Ah ha! Take that, you odiferous Shadow Fiends!! Victory!!! The day is won! "
"Then, a geyser appeared! Oh, what to do? How can evil be stopped? "
"Once again, like an unfaltering hero of legend, Tony saves the day! "
"Victory!!! The town is-- "
"Kyros? You mean Tony is the legendary Great Magus Kyros? "
"Sorry about what I said earlier. "
"Ha ha ha... if you want help finding a Lava Arboll, I doubt you'll get it from anyone in town. Nobody except Valkan has ever caught one. "
"YOU! I knew you stole that key. Get out of my town! You make me sick! "
"Haven't you closed that geyser yet? "
"Go away. I'm trying to read. "
"You made it! Wonderful! Please stay in town as long as you'd like. "
