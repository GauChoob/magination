"How pitiful. "
"Ahh, Sarbil, please show our guest the door. "
"Hiii there! "
"What's the matter, boy? I told you we'd meet again. You should be happy! "
"Ho ho! Because I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. "
"Very well, I'll just assume you're interested. "
"Here is my offer: we don't have to fight. I am willing to simply give you the Core Stone, and I will allow you to use it to get home. "
"All you have to do is stay out of our way. "
"Well? What do you say? You don't care at all about these fools. They're not of your kind, not of your world. You could be at home right now, with your friends... your family... I'm sure they're all worried about you! "
"Yes? "
"Ooh, WHATEVER! "
"I will wait for you where the path here ends. You'll have plenty of time to make your choice, since you will be taking the long way. Consider the difficult path as punishment for your indecision. "
"Until later... "
"There you are. I was getting impatient. "
"So have you made your decision? I have the Core Stone right over there. If you will simply take it, and return to your world I will allow it. "
"But if you refuse... "
"Very well. So you stand against us. "
"Good. I knew you'd see it my way. "
"You disappoint me, boy. You're no better than those children of Agadon. "
"I didn't want to have to do this... I thought you would do the sensible thing, but... "
"I'm sending you to the Abyss! This is the end, boy! "
"Here. You may leave my domain now. Do not waste any more time in this world. "
"Just leave, boy! Don't forget our bargain. "
"Hmmmm... "
"...I see. So that's how it is. "
"Tell me, what are you doing here? "
"Ha! Is that the real reason? "
"Foolish boy, Warrada the Shadow sees all. "
"I have been watching you, Tony Jones. I know why you need the Core Stones. You don't care at all about the idiots in this world, do you? "
"Hmph. You're no fun at all. "
"But I think you have answered my question. We will meet again, I'm sure. "
"How pitiful. "
"Ahh, Sarbil, please show our guest the door. "
"We had a deal. "
"Do I hear excuses? Is that what I hear?! "
"I'm sorely disappointed in you, boy. I made this offer with good intentions. You get to go home, and my master Agram would be able to complete his mission and wipe out all of Agadon's tribe. "
"But you... helping these Arderial scum and halting our plans! This I will not forgive! "
"I'll send you to the Abyss! This is the end for you! "
