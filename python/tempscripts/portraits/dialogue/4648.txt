"Are you sure you've trained enough? "
"Well in that case.. "
"Well in that case.. "
"........ "
"Tony, I want you to have this. "
"It will help you escape from dangerous areas. Do you know how to control the power of infused Animite? "
"Ha, okay. In that case, come with me to the Weave. There's a person there who you should- "
"Well... Yaki over there is the trainer of Vash Naroom. Here, I'll introduce you. "
"Tony, I'd like you to meet Yaki. Yaki, meet Tony. "
"Huh? "
"I... don't know! I think it's coming from the glade. "
"Hey! It's Eidon! Lower the stairs! "
"Come, Tony. "
"Hey! It's Eidon! Lower the stairs! "
"Come, Tony. "
"What are you asking me for?! I don't know! "
"This isn't good. Let's go see what's going on. "
"I lost track of Orwin. Did you see where he went? "
"Orwin, what- "
"You're delirious! Hold still! "
"He's in bad shape. "
"I'm going to take Orwin back to Vash Naroom. Right now seeing Gia would be your best bet. That energy band will let you pass those blocks to the West of Vash Naroom. "
"I hope so. You'd better get going... it's a pretty long walk to the Weave. "
"You want me to try and stop it? "
"That means, this must be... "
"Look! Things have not been right lately... The Dream Creatures have been acting strangely. Don't you understand what that means? Your stubbornness is going to be the end of this nation!  We have to tell him the truth. "
"But... I think that Gia would want to meet him! She might even be able to- "
"Hmmmmm..... "
"Oh, Tony.  I was just leaving for the Weave.  I see Pruitt made a fine ring for you. "
"Tony, follow me. There's somebody who I want you to meet. "
"This is very important. Trust me. "
"Pretty good, the party's great. If only I hadn't pulled a muscle chopping wood for Gia! "
"Tony! "
"Something horrible has happened. You must come with me. "
"Gia's waiting inside. "
"Be careful in the Shadow Geyser. "
"Good work, Tony. "
"Hmmm... I have no idea.  You should show that to Gia. "
"Gia is inside right now. "
"You need some Crystal Gloves? I can make you a pair in hardly no time at all! "
"Here you go, Tony! "
"With these you can dig through that softer dirt to the Underneath. The entrance is just North of here. "
"The Underneath has many strange species of fungus. "
"Tony! You are safe! What happened? "
"What? "
"I'll never understand the Caldlings. "
"Oh hello Tony, Gia's inside. "
"Nobody told you? I have been training under Gia for years. "
"Welcome back, Tony. "
"Okay, follow me. "
"... ...Tony. You're alive. "
"Something hit me after you were done fighting... I got kind of disoriented. What happened? "
"What? "
"Tony? What's wrong? "
"It doesn't matter anyway. "
"I'm so sorry, Tony.  I really feel that this is all my fault. If I had just listened to Orwin, you'd probably be home by now. "
"I'll be back in Vash Naroom if you need me. Gia's there, too. "
"So that's where soap comes from! I've always wondered about that. "
"What? What happened? "
"T-Tony! You... you're holding the Core Glyph! "
"You're going to find Morag? "
"Good job! "
"Shameful. Who would do such a thing? "
"TONY!!!! "
"Orwin is still very sick. "
"I'm sorry Tony. I was convinced that you were Kyros... this isn't the first time that's happened. I should have listened to Orwin... "
"I'm sorry Tony. I was convinced that you were Kyros... this isn't the first time that's happened. I should have listened to Orwin... "
"Orwin is almost dead. "
"......... "
"You should go visit Pruitt. Her shop is in the Southeast of Vash Naroom. "
"Hey Tony! you should check out the rest of Vash Naroom. Make sure you talk with Poad and Evu. "
"You should go visit Pruitt. Her shop is in the Southeast of Vash Naroom. "
"But Orwin... "
"I could have sworn the food he cooked gave me superhuman strength! But this time- "
"Okay, okay, I'm SORRY!! If you'd just listen, this time... "
"......... "
"Yes. Tony, I'd like you to meet Orwin, Elder of Vash Naroom. "
"I told you, I don't think he's from this world. "
"Well, I guess you'll have to stay in town. We'll get you out of here soon enough. In the mean time, take your crystal to Pruitt, the Ringsmith. If you get hungry, go see Poad at the Inn. "
"Tony! Are you okay? Take this to restore your strength! "
"Tony! Are you hurt? "
"That's good- "
"Well, Tony, I'm very sorry about all this. We were all so happy to hear of Agram's defeat, but Orwin passed away shortly after we heard the news. That could not be ignored. "
"Yes, of course. "
"Farewell, Tony. May our paths cross again some day. "
"Farewell, Tony. May our paths cross again some day. "
"Exploding sock puppet! "
"Taxi apple sponge! "
"Skunks playing poker, basketball cheesesteak! "
"Dirigible fork! "
"Whew, finally. That was getting silly. My name is Eidon. "
"Tony, I saw how you handled yourself against those fiends back there. May I see the ring you used to call that creature? "
"You don't have a ring? What's that on the ground? "
"You used THAT to summon the creature? "
"I've never seen anything like this... you're not from around here, are you? "
"Tavel Gorge? Never heard of it. The world is truly vast! Well, if you don't know your own way back, I'm sure Orwin could tell you. He's the elder of Vash Naroom. Come, I'll take you there. "
"This way Tony! "
"I do. It is the vow of an elder. "
"Yes, Gia... "
"Yes, Gia... "
