"Valkan knows everything! You should talk to him. "
"Hey, did you know? Lava Arbolls like the smell of those lava vents North of here. They follow Arbolits around, looking for easy prey. "
"What are you doing here? "
"Aren't you supposed to stop that geyser? "
"Valkan is a hero in our town. "
"Tony is a hero in our town. "
"There's this huge black mass coming out of the lava pool up there! "
"EEEEK! SHADOW MAGI ARE LAYING WASTE TO THE TOWN! HELP!! "
"RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIIVES!!! "
"Hey, I think you're right! "
"The geyser is gone! We found this kid out by where it was. "
"HELP!! "
"Please stop the rest of these fiends! "
"Why are they attacking us? "
"Valkan saved my life! "
"And I just saw Orwin running through town like a madman! Where's he going in such a hurry? "
"I'm sure Orwin went this way. I hope he's all right! "
"I think Orwin went up that way. "
"Doesn't seem like Orwin is around here... Uh... wha? Where'd everyone go? "
"Where's Gogor going? "
"Hey, it's the Great Magus! Remember me? "
"You ever find any algae? "
"Wow, you really found some algae. I'm impressed. Can I have it? "
"Thanks, you don't know how much I appreciate this. "
"Well, I hope that stuff is useful to you. "
"Now if I could just figure out where I need to use this algae. Let me think... "
"Thanks for freeing me! I really didn't like it in that prison. Here, I have an extra one of these. "
"Thanks again for freeing me! "
"Hey, Tony! Go check out the magic show. "
"The people in this town are fools. "
"It's too hot to move around here. "
"Hmph. "
"I've never seen a geyser. "
"The bridges here were all built by Valkan. "
"You're still alive? Cool! "
"Don't hurt me! "
"Well, then, see you around! "
"Don't hurt me! "
"Well, then, see you around! "
"Look at the damage the town has suffered.... "
"The poor mushrooms! "
"WAIT!!! I wanna see! "
"NO! I said I wanna see! "
"AIIIIGGGHHH!! "
"Phew..... "
"He thinks he is such a hotshot! "
"Hey, what are you doing here? "
"Oh, I get it. You're taking the key, huh? Don't worry, I won't rat you out. "
"In fact, if I were you, I'd hold on to that! That key unlocks almost every locked door in the world! Too bad you got it before me, but that's life. See ya! "
"If only we had a Cloud Frond! "
"Have you met Gruk? Gruk's mushroom farm is famous around here. "
"What the heck is a Fakroo? "
"Hey! Watch where you're walking. "
"Because you might destroy some of the evidence! "
"Exactly! And what do you think destroyed it? "
"A giant Dream Creature! I don't know who summoned it, but it was bigger than anything ever seen before. I have suspected that it exists here in the Underneath for quite some time, but this is the first real proof. "
"Yes. And I plan to find and catch it! "
"I was. But you just walked all over the evidence. "
"It's too late now, you've already ruined it. The only way to track it now is with some glowing Deep Algae. "
"Thanks. In the meantime I'll be at the abandoned fort to the North. See you later. "
"You are the one who freed me from my prison. Please take this item as a reward. "
"Thanks again for freeing me! "
"Did you know that Greater Hyrens are only found in hidden areas? "
"It's stronger in this direction! "
"That must be what's causing it! "
"Who are you anyway? "
"I don't recognize him... "
"Did you do this? "
"You liar. You must have done it! "
"Let's take him back to town. The Elder will know what to do with him. "
"Look! The geyser is gone! "
"Of course he did! He's the only one here, right? "
"Wow! That thing was huge! How did you manage to stop it? "
"We were wrong about you, man. "
"Let's take him to the elder. He will be very pleased! "
"Long live Eidon! "
"Hey, you're pretty good! "
"WOOOOOO! This is great! "
"Just watch me! "
