"We'll be moving the city soon, so I'd suggest you take care of all your business here. "
"Any luck, Tony? "
"Is that so. "
"Be careful Tony, it's dangerous out there. "
"I'm sorry Blu. "
"I heard you before, Blu, but my mind is made up. "
"This is the boy? "
"Pleased to meet you, Tony. My name is Mobis, and I am the elder of Oscent Mar. "
"Normally I would be welcoming you to our city, but I'm afraid I can't do that now. You see, recent events have placed us in peril.. I have decided that the city must be moved. "
"Why, the Giant Parathins on which our city rests will simply swim to a new location. In fact, many of our troops have already left for calmer waters. "
"Blu, you know that the troops I sent to the geyser have all fallen gravely ill!  Most are petrified, and the others have turned into mush! "
"!! "
"That's a Core Glyph. Where did you get that? "
"... I see. You are not a child of Agadon. I will leave behind a Giant Parathin for you, but you must promise me that you will close the geyser and then leave our world as soon as possible. "
"Very well. "
"No, Blu. Your new duty as Wellisk Trainer will prevent you from staying. "
"Orlon!! er... How fortuitous! "
"We... we were just leaving these waters! "
"I need your help. "
"This is Tony. He wishes to close the Shadow Geyser. "
"... Would you offer him your skills as a Ringsmith? "
"He'll have to do. Now, if you'll excuse, me, I must continue the preparations. "
