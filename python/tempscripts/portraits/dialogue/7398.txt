"Who? What are you talking about, sis? "
"......... "
"I hope Gogor doesn't do something stupid... "
"No you won't! "
"Ah, who are you? "
"Wow, it's rare to meet anyone new down here. My name's Ulk and I mine Animite down here. I was actually waiting for my friend Wence just now, but he's not here yet. "
"Do you know Wence? "
"Isn't he cool? I think my sister has the hots for him. Don't tell her I said so, though. "
"Her name is Gruk. She owns the Mushroom Farm just outside of town. She harvests the best mushrooms you'll ever taste! "
"But lately, she's been so tired... harvesting mushrooms is hard work, but I think she might be pushing herself too hard. When I talked to her earlier she said she was having trouble sleeping because of loud noises below her house. I tried to get Gogor to check it out but he's SO darn self-absorbed! So that's why I'm waiting for Wence... "
"What a buffoon. He's the hero of our town... a big, narcissistic, completely dense hero. I don't know what the other townspeople see in him. What a fool... "
"Oh, I'm rambling. Sorry about that. Well thanks for talking with me, Tony! "
"Nope, Wence still isn't here yet... "
"......... "
"Can you walk? "
"It's not safe out here. Come on, let's go wait in Gogor's house. "
"... er... uh... His place is closer... Let's just go! "
"My sister came back! I'm so happy! Are you the one that helped save her? "
"Thanks, uh... what was your name again? "
"Thanks, Tony! Sis went back to the farm to rest, but she says thanks too. "
"Tony, I'm not trying to be rude, but why are you here in the Underneath anyway? Are you lost? "
"Really? Who? "
"Wha whoa! Earthquake! "
"We can't! It's too dangerous to wander around now! "
"SHUT UP GOGOR!! This is no time to be macho! "
"Sis! What happened? "
"Really? "
"What did you do with Gruk? What do you want from us?! "
"This is ridiculous. "
"Me neither... "
"What are we going to do, Motash? What's gonna happen to Gruk? "
"Hi Tony... "
"Gogor, you idiot! We were all worried about you! You were alive all this time and you never bothered to come back?! You JERK! "
"JERK!! "
"...really? "
"Oh, shut up Gogor! We were... I... was... d'oh, you IDIOT!!! "
"Grrr... "
"GOGOR! You get back here! "
"Gogor? "
"Gogor... "
"Gogor, you idiot! We were all worried about you! You were alive all this time and you never even bothered to come back?! You... JERK!! "
"JERK!!! "
"Really? "
"Oh, shut up Gogor! We... I... was... d'oh, you IDIOT! "
"Get back here Gogor! We're not done yet! "
