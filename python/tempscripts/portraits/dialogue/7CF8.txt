"WOOO! THAT'S THE SPIRIT! Okay, here's the basics. There are two kinds of battles you can get into. One is Creature battle, and the other is Magi battle. Creature battle is when you're just fighting Dream Creatures so you can nab 'em! Magi battle is a duel between you and another Magi! All battles happen turn by turn, and you get ONE -  that's right, just ONE -  action each turn. Each action takes some time to perform, so watch it! "
"I'll spare you the details for now, but the actions are FOCUS, SUMMON, SPELL, ITEM, and RUN! "
"Basically, the creatures you summon take the damage for you. The only time you yourself take damage is when you don't have any creatures summoned, or if the opponent has a special ability to do that. "
"OOOOOH YEAHHH! THAT'S EASY! Beat down all those creatures and YOU WIN, BROTHER! And in Magi battles... this includes the guy that's controlling the creatures. Of course, if you and all your creatures get beat up, YOU LOSE! ...HOWEVER!!! As long as you still have a creature summoned, you can be in the worst shape possible and still win! So don't give up! And when the fight's over, your creatures' leftover energy will return to you! WOO!! "
"The FIRST, and MOST IMPORTANT ACTION, brother, is SUMMON!! OOOOOH YEAHHH! There's only so much a Magi can do just by himself, so SUMMONING CREATURES is the best way to attack your opponents AND the best way to defend against them! "
"LOTS OF STUFF! Different creatures have different actions, and each turn, your creatures will do the action you tell them to do. They get one action per turn, like you. "
"BUT REMEMBER THIS NEXT PART! There are some downsides!! For one, it takes some of your own energy to call one of these creatures. Second, you can only have out FOUR creatures at a time! And third, creatures don't get to do any actions on the turn you summon them!! So be careful, dude! "
"CASTING SPELLS! DIG IT! Spells can deal damage, cure ailments, or power up your creatures. They also happen faster than most other actions. But spells take your energy to perform, so try not to depend on them too much! "
"ITEMS! WOO! Every now and then it helps to restore your creature's energy with a Baloo Leaf or improve your creature's power with a Power Gem. Items are all over! You can find 'em, or go to a shop and buy em! But LISTEN UP! Some items can't be bought at the store. For those items you gotta look around. It could be lying around or a creature might be protecting it! So explore! "
"DIG IT!! FOCUS can be useful in some situations. It can give you that extra energy you need to bring out that important creature or spell. It can also help you recover when your creatures have the battle under control. "
"Always remember to WATCH YOUR ENERGY! Don't drain yourself with spells if you don't have a good defense. 'Cause if you and your creatures run out of energy, it's ALL OVER! "
"Don't be afraid to RUN if you have to! You don't get any reward for running away, but you would think avoiding a huge beatdown is enough for most people! Unfortunately, you can only run away from Creature battles. Magi battles are honorable duels so don't do anythin' cowardly or you'll be made fun of! "
"A Creature battle is easy to get into! Whenever some creatures are nearby, you'll see a burst of Dream Energy! Just run right into it and you'll find creatures! From there, you can do battle and try to nab 'em! "
"Want to know anything else, brother? "
"OOOOOH YEAHHH! DIG IT! WOOO! "
"OOOOHHHH YEAH! Gotta run those laps! Gotta be fit! WOOOO!! "
"...YOU! Training is good for you! Don't you forget that, brother! Repeat after me... IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!! "
"LOUDER!!!! "
"Good. You pass. Back to my workout! WOO!!! "
"OOOOHHHH YEAH! DIG IT!!! No time to talk, brother, gotta run! Gotta run fast! WOOOO!! "
"OOOH YEAAHH!! Dig it! WOOO!! You came back to do some more trainin', eh? Want to refresh your knowledge? "
"Well get over there and get to beatin' up those Dream Creatures! WOOOOO!!! "
"Hey! You're not allowed in there! "
"And stay out! "
"OOOOOH YEAHHH!! How ya doin', brother! I'm the guy that's gonna tell ya how to nab those Dream Creatures and beat 'em senseless! Er, I mean... beat 'em and nab 'em! WOOO! So WHATCHA GONNA DO?! "
"OOOH YEAH!!! What's shakin', brother! "
"OOOOOH YEAHHH! DIG IT! WOOO! "
"Orwin, I'm gonna honor your memory for life, brother! "
"OOOHH YEAHH! Hey Brother, whatcha doin' in the cald? "
"Training mission, brother. DIG IT WOO! Salafy'll be running the grounds til I get back, so go easy on her til I get back, brother. "
