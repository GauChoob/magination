"Eidon! What in blazes is going on?! "
"And you have the boy with you! You FOOL! "
"It's coming from the glade! I will deal with you later. "
"Since you have done so much for us... "
"What the...?! "
"It looks like ..... a Shadow Geyser! Oh, no... this too was foretold in the Prophecy! "
"I've got to stop it! "
"OOUGGH!! like a million... sharp... needles just pierced my hide! "
"I used my hood of hiding... to save myself... The... geyser... must be... stopped.. "
"Take this... "
"This will... let you pass... through the forest.  Go see Gia... in the Weave... "
"Eidon... the geyser... "
"NO YOU FOOL!... oww... don't try to... enter or... you'll end up... like me... "
"Tony, come... here... "
"Why are you so persistent? Even if he IS the Great Magus Kyros, we'd be better off sending him back to his world! "
"I've heard enough, Eidon. I want you to leave Vash Naroom until all this blows over. "
"I forbid you to take him from this town. Magus or not, the kid stays here. My word is final. "
"Yes... "
"Gia, what is to happen now that the Kyros prophecy has been fulfilled? "
"Yes, I suppose I do. "
"Pumpkin... melty... ...... ...GAHH! "
"...my... purple... ..... cheese... ... ...grater... "
"Thank you lad I owe you my life. "
"AAAAAAGHHH!!! "
"Am... I... alive? I'm alive!? I'M ALIVE! ALIVE!! "
"Thank you lad, I owe you my life. "
"Thank you lad, I owe you my life. "
"....... "
"Zzz... "
"No! I will not go through this  again! "
"NO, Eidon! You think someone is Kyros every year! Let's see, who was it last year? Poad? What were you thinking?! "
"...and before that was Yaki! We couldn't shut him up for months! He went around shouting "
"Ah, this must "
"Yes, yes. So you wish to get home, right? Where did you say you were from? "
"Tavel... "
"I've been from here to Orothe and back, but that name doesn't ring a bell. "
"Well, this is a dilemma. I will try to figure out a way to get you home, but you must stay in town until then. "
"Quiet you! I need to think. "
"Don't Follow Eidon on some foolish mission! "
"Sorry for being so childish. I hope there aren't any hard feelings. "
