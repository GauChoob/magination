"-yaaaawn- Excuse me... welcome to Gruk's Mushroom Farm! Can I help you? "
"-yawn- Thank you. "
"What? Oh, it's nothing. I just can't sleep at night because of those darn noises in the basement. I would check them out myself but I'm afraid to go down there... "
"You two smell! Why should I go with you? "
"Hehe, that's funny... "
"Hey, what are you doing?! HEY! STOP!! AAAAAAAAHH!!! "
"Wence! "
"Where are you going?! "
"Yep! We're all okay! Well, mostly. "
"Well... "
"When everyone got back, this floating guy appeared in town along with a whole bunch of goons like the ones that kidnapped me. He captured Motash, and he was just about to blast us all, but Gogor... "
"...Gogor... shielded us from the blast and then he was gone. It gave us a chance to make our escape, but Ulk hasn't been very happy since. "
"What? "
"Really? Great! I've got to go tell Ulk! See you later, Tony! Later, Wence! "
"He's alive, Ulk! He's alive! "
"He's alive, Ulk! He's alive! "
"Gogor! He's alive! And he's probably in town somewhere! "
"Come on, let's go find him! I'm tired of seeing you sulk around all day like this! "
"I'm right here, Gogor. "
"Yeah sure, that's what happened. You sure know how to make an entrance, don't you? "
"Ha ha. You're so weird. "
"Good idea. Oh, it's you! Hi, um... "
"Hi, Tony! Did you find out what was in my basement? "
"Just kidding! It was probably just those two guys that kidnapped me. I should be able to rest more easily now that they're gone. Let's go! "
"Be careful. "
"Yeah... I think so. "
"......... Why not your house? "
"Something just burst up from the ground near the farm... then this quake started and destroyed my house! Oww... "
"Ungh... it was some kind of large... black thing... "
"Be careful... the quake is much stronger there... "
"Nice to see you're okay. "
