"We meet again, Kyros! I must admit, I am impressed that you were able to dispose of Zet, and relieved that you were able to rid me of Korg. It seems that, in the end, you have been quite a help to me after all! "
"And Jaela! How does it feel to be powerless royalty? Unable to do anything while your subjects are suffering? "
"Nothing to say? One would think you have a lot on your mind right now. Why don't you ask one of the other regions for help? "
"Come, Jaela, say something! I'm dying to hear what's on your mind. "
"What's that? I can't hear you! "
"Ha! You fool, I am much more powerful than I was back then. Observe. "
"What?! "
"This is impossible! You are nothing before my-- "
"You've found him. Now what will you do? Ha ha ha ha! "
"Just be glad that you both get to live, for now. Korg, Zet... we're off. "
"Oh, this is so pathetic!! "
"Out of my way, you wretched charlatans! "
"We meet again, Great Magus Kyros! "
"SILENCE! "
"Hand over the Great Magus. "
"Fools will be dealt with. Well Kyros, will you come with me now? Or shall I punish more of them? "
"FOOL! "
"Enough of this. Seize him! "
"You have been such a nuisance. Normally I would just eradicate you from my life right here... "
"...but Agram has other plans for you. "
"You won't get away so easily. Grab him! "
"I can't believe I have to let you live this time... "
"...but it seems Agram has something else in store for you. "
"Okay, that's good enough. Tell the others to return to the Core and wait for me. "
"Ha ha ha ha! What power! It just gets stronger every time I do it! "
"You want to say something, old woman? "
"Hmph. The fact you know who I am makes no difference. "
"......... Heh... Hehe... HAHAHAHAHAHA!! Ah, now that I think of it, such a fate is not good enough "
"HA HA HAHAHA!! Squirm, you old hag!! "
"Pfft. Annoying little whelp. "
"Ha ha ha ha! You're the one who keeps destroying my gates? What a joke! "
"Yes, and I'll have no more interference from you. Die! "
"Grr... what... "
"Blast it all, this is so annoying! "
"You got lucky, kid. I'm tired of wasting my time here. "
"...and as for you: my NAME is Morag. Your life will soon be forfeit. Mark my words! "
"So, you want to stand up for these people? You are not even worth my time. "
"I've wanted to finish this for a long time, Kyros. "
"Give my regards to Agadon! "
"It's useless, don't you see? "
"You are quite naive, Kyros. Do you really think you can set things to go your way now that they are completely within our grasp? This 'geyser' cannot be stopped, even if you do remove the Core Stone that created it. There is not a thing you can do. We've won! "
"Ha ha ha! How interesting! And what might that be? "
"Eh? You're coming after me?! Oh this is hilarious!! HA AHA AHAHAHA! "
"You can't beat me! Remember all the times I've smacked you around? "
"Ha ha ha... well, if it's a fight you want, you've got one. I guess Agram won't get his wish of taking you alive after all. Your life is OVER! "
"Magnificent. The lava flowing around it insures that nobody will stop this one! "
"Not even you, so-called Great Magus Kyros! "
"You have not been even a small challenge for me. Truly pathetic. But I do so hate to dirty my hands with the blood of others. So rather than blowing you to bits, I'll give you a nice, hot bath instead. "
"Huh? "
"Damn, I can't let them see me now... this is NOT over, Kyros. "
