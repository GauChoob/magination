"I am the Omnipotent Oracle! I know all things about all people! "
"Hey! It's that psychic kid! Back to marvel at my amazing feats of intelligence? "
"Ah, hello young man. Have you come to marvel at my amazing feats of intelligence? "
"Really? ......... I mean... uh... okay, let's play a game! I'll explain if you want. "
"-Ahem- ......... Okay... Uh... yeah. Let's begin. "
"Ah, yes... the game. Okay. Here's how it goes. Are you ready? Because I will tell you! Right now! "
"MY AWESOME POWER IS NOW IN USE! "
"Okay, I've got it! Yes yes! "
"I am thinking of THREE... I mean ONE person. I will list three Magi for you, and you guess which one I am now thinking of! Easy, right? What? What do you mean it's not fair? Oh fine, I'll give you a hint if you really want it. BUT ONLY ONE HINT! Of course, if your knowledge power is great, you won't need the hint. Anyway, do you understand? "
"You know... my powers. Of knowing. That stuff. ......... Never mind. "
"Okay, now... I'm ready! "
"Your choices are... "
"Pruitt? "
"Ulk? "
"Poad? "
"I already gave you a hint. "
"This person is short. "
"She is a girl. "
"This person is from Naroom. "
"Your choices are... "
"Poad? "
"Orwin? "
"Valkan? "
"I already gave you a hint. "
"This person is short. "
"This guy wears a headband. "
"This person is from Naroom. "
"Your choices are... "
"Magam? "
"Orlon? "
"Ashgar? "
"I already gave you a hint. "
"This person is a Ringsmith. "
"He is a man. "
"This person is from Cald. "
"Sorry, that's not who I was thinking of. You lose! "
"That's right! "
"Wow! You didn't even need a hint! Your knowledge power is very impressive! "
"Hello Tony, what can I.... "
".......You... found it! "
"With this, Orwin can be saved! We have no time to lose! "
"You! "
"What are you doing here? "
"Nevermind! I already know what you are here for. "
"Yes! I am the All Knowing, All Powerful Wizard am I not? "
"Yes! "
"You mean you haven't heard of me? "
"I am the Omniscient Enchanter! "
"The Magnificent Magician! "
"What about the Clairvoyant Conjurer? "
"The... Ahh.. the Super Sorcerer? "
"The Seer? You came all the way here just to talk to the Seer? "
"....... "
"What? Oh sorry... I mean doesn't the title 'Seer' seem a little unimpressive to you? "
"Don't you think people would respect The Grand Guru or The Stupendous Spellcaster more than some plain... "
"Well... Yes... "
"I am the Seer. Why did you come to me? "
"They did!? ..uh I mean.. Orwin is sick? "
"Wow. Uh.. Let's go see him then. "
"I am the Seer. And I know you are the Great Magus Kyros. Fine work on healing Orwin, but know that danger still lies ahead of you. "
"It is the only thing standing between Orwin and a full recovery... "
"Hey look! He has a Cloud Frond! "
"LET'S GO! "
"Orwin is sick. "
"I think that his injuries are more than just physical. He has burns on his hands and face, but they are not severe enough to weaken  him this significantly. I think he is poisoned. "
"You need to find something to neutralize the geyser's effect. I can think of only  one item sufficiently powerful to cure Orwin's ailments. "
"It is extremely rare and powerful. "
"It must be specially  prepared into an elixir to cure Orwin. "
"It can't be found in any stores! "
"Oh!  A Cloud Frond. "
"I will make the Cloud Frond Elixir if you can get one. "
"...Hmmmm I must meditate on the subject. Why don't you see if you can find one on your own, and check back with me if you need advice. "
"If you need me, I will be back at my boathouse, meditating. "
"I've given him a dose. All we can do now is wait. "
"Hmm.. maybe I should give him some more. "
"Hmm.. perhaps I should.. "
"Well... My work here is done. "
